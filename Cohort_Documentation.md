# SDLC and AGILE

**Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):**

Comprises of 3 parts:  

- Software  
- Development  
- Life Cycle

**Software** can be considered an application that comprises a set of instructions that is given to a computer to meet various needs.

**Development** is the progressive evolution of the software to become more scalable and thrive in the day-to-day world.

**Life cycle** is the process in which the software matures, i.e., it evolves in every single step to meet the needs.

The SDLC is a systematic approach followed by software developers to design, develop, and test high-quality products. It consists of several stages, each focusing on a specific aspect of software creation.  
It is made sure that at the end of the process, the product delivered is able to meet the user’s need.

**SDLC Phases:**

Phase 1:   Planning

* It identifies if there is any need to develop new software or tries to bridge the gap between an already existing software.  
* The client, users, and managers collaborate to define system requirements.  
* The project’s objective, scope, and feasibility are assessed.

Phase 2:    Analysis

* This focuses on the business requirements.  
* It is focused on creating a process diagram.  
* Then a detailed analysis of the whole process is done to figure out whether the process is feasible or not.


Phase 3:   Design

* Based on the gathered requirements, the architecture of the software is designed. This includes both high-level and detailed designs, defining how the system will work and how components will interact.


Phase 4:   Development

* This phase is focused on programming the source code.   
* Create graphics  
* Compile the assets into an executable program


Phase 5:   Testing

* The developed software is rigorously tested to ensure it functions as expected and is free of bugs. Various testing types include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.


Phase 6:   Deployment

* After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment for real-world use. It might be released in stages.


Phase 7:    Maintainence

* Once deployed, the software enters the maintenance phase. During this time, any defects that arise are fixed, and updates or new features may be added.

**SDLC Models:**

* **Waterfall Model:**  
- A linear and sequential model where each phase must be completed before the next one starts.  
- Specifically used for small projects with a shorter timeframe and a low budget.


  Requirement and Analysis —--\> Design  —--\> Implement —--\> Testing —--\> Deployment —--\> Maintainence


  

* **V-Model:**  
-  An extension of the waterfall model, where each development phase is associated with a corresponding testing phase.  
- Specifically used for small to medium-sized projects where early listing is required.  
- Each step is followed by a testing or validation phase.  
    
  Requirement Analysis—-\> Testing  
  Function Specification —---\> Testing  
  Design  —---\> Testing  
  Detailed Design —----\> Testing  
  Code —--\> Test Cases  
  Deployment  
    
* **Agile Model:**   
- A flexible and iterative model that focuses on continuous feedback and improvements through small, incremental releases.  
    
    
* **Iterative Model:**   
- A model where software is developed in iterations, with each iteration improving and adding functionality to the previous version.  
    
* **Spiral Model:**   
- Combines iterative development with risk analysis, moving in a spiral approach to complete projects with higher risk.

**AGILE Framework:**

The Agile framework is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that focuses on flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery. Unlike traditional SDLC models like Waterfall, Agile allows for continuous improvement through multiple iterations, known as sprints, making it highly adaptable to changes in requirements or priorities. It emphasizes breaking down the project into smaller, manageable pieces and delivering functional software in short timeframes.

**Key Concepts in Agile:**

* **Sprints:** Agile projects are divided into sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. Each sprint focuses on delivering a working piece of the software, which is reviewed by stakeholders.  
    
* **Scrum:** One of the most popular Agile frameworks. It includes specific roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog), and ceremonies (Daily Standups, Sprint Planning, Sprint Retrospective).  
    
* **User Stories:** Simple descriptions of a software feature from the end-user perspective.   
    
* **Backlog:** A prioritized list of user stories or tasks that need to be completed in future sprints.  
    
* **Burndown Chart:** A visual representation of work completed versus work remaining in a sprint, helping track progress.

**Agile phases:**

* Project Initiation  
* Sprint Planning  
* Development  
* Production  
* Retirement

### **Agile Frameworks:**

1. **Scrum**: A structured framework with specific roles and ceremonies.  
2. **Kanban**: Focuses on visualizing the workflow with boards that track the progress of tasks.  
3. **Lean**: Aims at optimizing efficiency by eliminating waste in the development process.  
4. **XP (Extreme Programming)**: Focuses on technical excellence, with practices like pair programming and test-driven development (TDD).

**SCRUM:  A subset of AGILE**

Scrum is one of the most popular frameworks within the Agile methodology, designed to manage complex projects through incremental and iterative processes. It focuses on delivering functional software in short cycles called sprints. Scrum encourages collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement, and it is particularly well-suited for projects with rapidly changing requirements.

### **Key Components of Scrum:**

#### **1\. Scrum Roles:**

* **Product Owner**:  
  * Represents the stakeholders and is responsible for defining the features of the product.  
  * Maintains the product backlog, a prioritized list of tasks or features.  
  * Communicates the vision of the product and ensures the team is building the right product.  
* **Scrum Master**:  
  * Acts as a facilitator for the team and ensures that the Scrum framework is followed correctly.  
  * Helps remove any impediments or blockers that might slow down the development team.  
  * Ensures that communication flows smoothly between the product owner and the development team.  
* **Development Team**:  
  * A cross-functional group responsible for delivering the product increment during each sprint.  
  * Self-organizing, meaning the team decides how to complete the work within each sprint.

#### **2\. Scrum Artifacts:**

* **Product Backlog**:  
  * A dynamic and prioritized list of all features, enhancements, and fixes required for the product.  
  * Managed by the product owner, the backlog evolves as new features are added or priorities change.  
* **Sprint Backlog**:  
  * A subset of the product backlog that the team commits to delivering during a single sprint.  
  * Owned by the development team, it represents the tasks they will focus on during that sprint.  
* **Increment**:  
  * The usable and potentially shippable product produced after each sprint. It adds value to the product, and each increment builds on the previous one.

#### **3\. Scrum Ceremonies (Events):**

* **Sprint**:  
  * A time-boxed period (usually 1-4 weeks) where the development team works to deliver a set of tasks from the Sprint Backlog.  
  * Each sprint aims to produce a shippable product increment that can be reviewed by stakeholders.  
* **Sprint Planning**:  
  * A meeting held at the beginning of each sprint to define what will be delivered during the sprint and how the team will achieve it.  
  * The team collaborates with the product owner to select items from the product backlog and create a sprint goal.  
* **Daily Scrum (stand-up)**:  
  * A short (15-minute) daily meeting where the development team discusses progress, plans for the day, and any blockers.  
  * The goal is to ensure everyone is aligned and moving toward the Sprint Goal.  
* **Sprint Review**:  
  * Held at the end of the sprint to demonstrate the work completed during the sprint to stakeholders.  
  * Feedback is gathered, and the product backlog is updated based on new insights.  
* **Sprint Retrospective**:  
  * A reflection meeting where the team discusses what went well during the sprint, what didn’t, and how they can improve in future sprints.  
  * This ceremony focuses on continuous improvement and optimizing the team’s processes.

### **Scrum Workflow:**

1. **Product Backlog Creation**: The product owner creates and prioritizes the product backlog based on customer requirements and business needs.  
2. **Sprint Planning**: The Scrum team selects items from the product backlog and defines a sprint goal.  
3. **Sprint Execution**: The team works on completing the selected tasks during the sprint, with daily stand-up meetings to ensure alignment.  
4. **Sprint Review**: At the end of the sprint, the team presents the completed work to stakeholders for feedback.  
5. **Sprint Retrospective**: The team reflects on their performance and identifies areas for improvement in the next sprint.  
6. **Repeat**: The process continues with subsequent sprints until the project is completed.

### **Advantages of Scrum:**

* **Quick delivery of value**: Scrum focuses on delivering working software at the end of each sprint.  
* **High flexibility**: Scrum allows for changes in requirements, as the backlog is regularly updated based on stakeholder feedback.  
* **Improved collaboration**: Frequent communication between the Product Owner, development team, and stakeholders ensures everyone is aligned.  
* **Continuous improvement**: The Sprint Retrospective encourages the team to learn from each sprint and improve its processes.  
* **Customer satisfaction**: Regular product reviews with stakeholders ensure that their feedback is incorporated into the product.

### **Challenges in Scrum:**

* **Requires commitment**: Scrum requires a high level of commitment and discipline from all team members to stick to the time-boxed sprints and deliver on promises.  
* **Scope creep**: Without proper backlog management, new features can constantly be added, potentially derailing progress.  
* **Team dependencies**: Scrum works best with cross-functional teams. If team members rely heavily on external resources, it can slow down progress.
